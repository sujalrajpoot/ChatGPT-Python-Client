# ü§ñ ChatGPT Python Client

## üìù Description
A modern, object-oriented Python client for interacting with chat models. This project demonstrates advanced Python concepts including OOP design patterns, type hinting, error handling, and clean code principles.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer
This code is provided **strictly for educational purposes** to demonstrate Python programming concepts and software architecture patterns. It should NOT be used to:
- Circumvent any terms of service
- Access services without proper authorization
- Engage in any form of API abuse or misuse
- Cause harm to any services or organizations

Please respect all terms of service and use official APIs for production applications.

## ‚ú® Features
- üéØ Type-safe implementation with modern Python type hints
- üõ°Ô∏è Robust error handling with custom exception hierarchy
- üîÑ Clean, maintainable OOP design
- üìä Support for multiple chat models
- ‚ö° Efficient session management
- üîç Comprehensive input validation
- üìù Detailed logging and error reporting

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture
The project follows a clean, modular architecture:
- `ChatModelEnum`: Enumeration of supported models
- `Message`: Dataclass for chat message representation
- `ChatClientBase`: Abstract base class defining the client interface
- `ChatGPT`: Concrete implementation with full functionality
- Custom exception hierarchy for granular error handling

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
python >= 3.7
cloudscraper
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sujalrajpoot/ChatGPT-Python-Client.git
cd ChatGPT-Python-Client

# Install dependencies
pip install cloudscraper
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from chat_client import ChatGPT, ChatModelEnum

# Initialize client
client = ChatGPT()

# Send a message
try:
    response = client.chat("Hello!", ChatModelEnum.GPT4O)
    print(response)
except ChatGPTError as e:
    print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
```

## üîß Configuration
The client can be configured with custom parameters:
```python
client = ChatGPT(
    timeout=30,  # Request timeout in seconds
    stream_chunk_size=1000  # Size of streaming chunks
)
```

## üéØ Error Handling
The client implements a comprehensive error handling system:
- `ChatGPTError`: Base exception class
- `ConnectionError`: Network-related issues
- `AuthenticationError`: Authentication failures
- `ParseError`: Response parsing problems

## üìö Best Practices
When using this code for learning:
- Study the OOP patterns implemented
- Understand the type hinting system
- Learn from the error handling architecture
- Examine the documentation practices
- Analyze the code organization

## üîí Security Notes
- Never store sensitive information in code
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement rate limiting in production code
- Follow security best practices
- Respect API terms of service

## üìñ Documentation
- Code includes comprehensive docstrings
- Type hints provide additional documentation
- Comments explain complex logic
- README covers all major features
- Examples demonstrate proper usage
